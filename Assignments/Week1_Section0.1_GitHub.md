## Setup Instructions Part 1 - GitHub, GitKraken and Atom
<a name="githubinst"></a>
#### 1. Setup account and install GitHub
  - Register for account on GitHub: <https://github.com/>
  - Check if you have GitHub installed and if not install it.  Directions for both Windows & Mac [here](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). Windows users should follow Option 1 in 6.2. Mac users can follow Option 1 in 6.3.
    - *Note:* If you are a Windows user make sure you also install [GitBash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash) as is noted in the instructions.
  - Setup options in Git. If you have a Mac, you can go to the terminal (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) as shown above. If you have a Windows, open Git BASH, which you should have downloaded.  You will need to  setup you [username](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git) and your [email](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address)
  - Generate a SSH key so you donâ€™t need to enter your password every time you interact with GitHub. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

<a name="GitKraken"></a>
#### 2.	Install **GitKraken** and link to your GitHub account
  - This is a handy GUI for working with Git Repos. You can get it [here](https:/www.gitkraken.com/). No need to worry about boards or timelines for now you canjust install the GUI.
  - You can also get a free upgrade to Git Kraken pro as a student if you go[here](https://education.github.com/pack?utm_source=github+gitkraken). This willlet you work with private as  well as public repos using Git Kraken.
  - After you have installed GitKraken follow the instructions [here](https://support.gitkraken.com/integrations/github/) to link to your GitHub account. **Note:** you can stop at the 'Oauth step' 

<a name="repo"></a>
#### 3. Clone the course materials repo to your computer
- Before you clone I recommend you start by creating a directory for this class where you will keep all of your repos. **NOTE:** It is best to create this directory as a local directory on your computer don't put it on OneDrive if you are using that.
- *GitKraken Approach*
  - In *GitKraken* got to `File/Clone Repo`
  - Use the `Browse` button to navigate to the directory you created for the class that you want your repo cloned to.
  - To get the `URL` open a web browser and go to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2021) for this course, click on the `Course-Materials21 Repo` and click on the green `code` button make sure `ssh` is underlined as the method to be used.
  - When you do this you should see a url for the repo with a clipboard symbol next to it. Click on the clipboard to copy the URL.
  - Paste this into the `URL` field in *GitKraken*

- *Command Line Approach*
    - **NOTE:** The *GitKraken* approach is a little easier but it is good to know that you can do this multiple ways. So you might want to create a different directory and practice cloning this again.
    - Make a directory for this class wherever you would like to have it on your computer
    - Open a terminal window and navigate to your course directory (you can do this using the commands cd and pwd)
    - Clone the main course materials repo: `git clone [ADD SSH]`
    - *if your ssh keys aren't setup you can also clone it like this* `git clone [ADD LINK]`

<a name="atom"></a>
#### 3.	Install the **Atom text editor**
 - This is a great text editor that has GitHub integration.You can install it for Mac or Windows [here](https://atom.io/)

<a name="classroom"></a>
## Setup Instructions Part 2 - Homework and GitHub Classroom
1. Once I have your GitHub IDs, I will give you a link to an assignment, either through email or the class page. You should follow the instructions for getting the homework repository set up included in this invitation. You should now have a repository for this homework.

      *Note:* After you accept an assignment for the first time, we will send you an invite to join the classroom organization as a member. **Please accept this.** You will probably get an email with the invitation, but you should also see a link at the top of your main GitHub page.

2. Clone your homework repo to your course work directory following the same steps you did to clone the course materials repo. **NOTE:** *DO NOT* clone your homework repo into the `Course-Materials` repo you already cloned. Just clone this into your main folder for the class so its sitting side by side with the `Course-Materials` repo

      *Note:* If you received an error in the above steps, you may have to clone with HTTPS instead of SSH. You can do this by again clicking on the "Clone or Download" button in the repository page, then clicking "Use HTTPS" in the top right of the pop-up box. Now copy the link and repeat this step.

## Assignment 1: First Forecast
This week you will generate your first streamflow forecast. The rules for this forecast are simple you will use only Excel to generate your forecasts and the most complicated mathematical operation you can do is take an average. You should make your forecast by simply looking at the historical streamflow and making your best guess of what you think it will be in the future based on whatever logic you want (no fancy calculations!). Don't worry we will get more sophisticated from here, but this week we start basic.

#### 1. Download the stream gauge observations to your homework repo
 The USGS NWIS website has all of the USGS maintained observation sites in the country. Go to their main [website](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) or their [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/) and download the following daily streamflow data for station  *09506000 Verde River Near Camp Verde* using the following parameters:
   - Daily Data
   - Parameter 00060 Discharge (mean)
   - Start date = 1989-01-01
   - End date = Today
   - Select 'tab separated'

- The data will load in a new tab of your browser. Right click and save it as a *streamflow_week1.txt* file in the *data* folder of your **homework repo**.

### 2. Import the data into Excel to look at it
- Open a new Excel workbook and copy and paste the text file into it.
- Use the `text to columns` option in the `data menu` and select `delimited` and by `tabs` to separate the data into columns (If tab doesn't work you can also delimit by `space`)
- Save your workbook as *streamflow_week1.xlsx* in the *assignment_1* folder.
- Read the documentation at the top of the file to understand the format of the data you have downloaded.
- Look at the streamflow values and decide what your forecasted flows will be (remember no math is expected here, the idea here is just to take a look at the historical flow and use your own judgement to make a forecast).  You need to make two forecasts all of which should be expressed as average daily flow in cfs (1) flow next week, (2) flow two weeks from now.

### 3. Submit your first forecast to the competition
- Clone the main class Forecasting repo from our course organization website [GitHub](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2021) (see instructions above and remember **DO NOT clone it inside another repo** just clone it into the directory for this class next to your others)
- To avoid conflicts make sure your local repo is up to date before you submit your forecast. You can do by typing `git pull` from terminal inside the course  repo folder or using the bottom bar of atom to do a fetch and then pull. Refer to the training materials for more information if you forget how to do this.
- Find the csv with your last name in the *forecast_entries* folder and enter your forecasts. Enter your forecasts on the row for foercast #1. A few notes:
    - Make sure you just enter numbers (i.e. enter 5 not 5 cfs)
    - Don't convert the file to an xlsx file keep it as a csv.
    - the one '1week' and '2week' refers to your forecasts for next week and the following week.  You can refer to the `forecasts_dates` files in the Forecast repo for more details.
- Save your changes, commit them, and push your changes. Again you can do this in GitKraken or on command line.

### 4. Submit your first forecast homework assignment
In addition to submitting your numerical forecasts to the forecast competition you also need to submit a description of your forecast through your homework repo. This is what I will be grading for credit.

- Create a file named `lastname_HW1.md` in the `submission` folder of your homework repo. The easiest way  to do this is just to create a new file in atom.

- Include a header in your file that includes, your name, the date, and the assignment number

- Write a few sentences describing the forecast you made and rational for making it.  Note that we aren't doing anything fancy this week so your rational can be very simple, I'm not looking for a lot of text or any external research. This is really just to practice getting files submitted on GitHub. Save your file.

- When you are done `commit` and `push` your changes to upload your changes. You can do this directly in atom.

## GitHub Cheat Sheet assignment:
- Over the course of the semester you will be creating a series of Cheat Sheets' to summarize the different concepts we cover. You can refer to the Cheat Sheets in the `Content` Folder for examples.
- It is entirely up to you though what yours should look like and note that you already have the ones I provided you so it doesn't need to be a duplicate of that. The point is for you to have a concise guide in your own words that will be helpful to you and that you can refer back to.
- This might take the form of a word document, a powerpoint slide, or even a hand written or drawn diagram, a jupyter notebook or pythhon script (when we get to those) or something more creative that I'm not thinking of yet :)
- In general I'm looking for something the equivalent of 1-2 pages long.
- All Cheat Sheet assignments will be graded pass/fail. If I determine yours needs work you will be able to resubmit the following Tuesday with a revised version.
- This week your Cheat Sheet should cover at a minimum:
  1. What is GitHub and version control
  2. What is a repo
  3. The difference between local, remote, origin
  2. The major actions and what they mean - Clone, Fork, Commit, Push, Pull, Fetch (note this could lend itself to a graphic illustration)
